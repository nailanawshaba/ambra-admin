Dear ${displayName},

We are delighted to welcome you to the PLOS ONE Editorial Board. There are a few things you need to do to be fully signed up to our system, so please spend 20 minutes or so setting up your profiles and familiarizing yourself with our systems.

1. Select a password for your PLOS account
With a PLOS account you can access both the password-protected portions of the journal sites (including plosone.org) and the Academic Editor Knowledge Base where editors gather to discuss the peer review process, and access our Academic Editor Handbook and other helpful resources designed to assist you in your work with us.

You can use your email address ${email} to sign into your PLOS account:

Please go here to set your new password: ${url}?email=${email?url}&verificationToken=${verificationToken?url}

After you sign in to the Knowledge Base, click on "Welcome to the Editorial Board" in the top menu to get started.

2. Editorial Manager: PLOS ONE Submission System
Access your account in Editorial Manager the online submission system here: http://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/default.asp . Your temporary username and password are:

Username: ${email}
Password: ${email}1

Be sure to use the "Editor Sign in" button to access the editor part of the site.

Once you have logged in, please follow the "Update my Information" link in the top left to verify that the information in your profile is correct, and update your username and password.

PLOS ONE staff will populate your account with classification terms based on the information you've provided. 
However, you may wish to review this information and ensure that it accurately reflects the types of papers you would like to handle as editor. This is extremely important as we use this information to match submitted papers to suitable Academic Editors.

We strongly recommend that you view your account at least once a week; it is therefore advisable to bookmark the link to the online submission site when you log on for the first time.

3. Training Videos for Academic Editors
Please visit http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/tag/plos-one-video-shorts/ to view our training videos; these videos were created by the PLOS ONE staff to show you how to perform various tasks in the Editorial Manager submission system. As above, you might find it useful to bookmark this page so that you can quickly access it when you are working in the system.

Welcome to the PLOS ONE Editorial Board and if you would like any further information, please do let me know and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.

Best wishes,
Kevin Floyd
Publications Assistant, PLOS ONE
